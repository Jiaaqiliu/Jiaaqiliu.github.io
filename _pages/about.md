I am a CS Ph.D. student at UNC Chapel Hill, supervised by [Prof. Mingyu Ding](https://dingmyu.github.io/) and [Prof. Huaxiu Yao](https://www.huaxiuyao.io/). I received both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees from Tongji University. I interned at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) as a visiting student researcher, where I collaborated with [Prof. Masayoshi Tomizuka](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/masayoshi-tomizuka/), [Prof. Mingyu Ding](https://dingmyu.github.io/),  and [Dr. Wei Zhan](https://zhanwei.site/).

My research interests include  vision-language model, RL for reasoning models , embodied AI, agent,  and autonomous vehicles. And my research goal is to improve the performance of LLMs and VLMs through reinforcement learning and other post-training techniques, and to leverage these models to build efficient and intelligent agents capable of interacting with the physical world (embodied intelligence) and driving scientific exploration (AI for Science).

I am actively seeking 2026 summer internships. Let's connect!


# 🔥 News
- *2025.09*: &nbsp; We released [SciReasoner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21320), a scientific reasoning foundation model covering 103 tasks. It is pretrained on a 206B-token corpus and further enhanced through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to continually improve its reasoning ability. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on more than 50 tasks.
